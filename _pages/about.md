Welcome to my page! 

I’m a cognitive neuroscience researcher currently doing my PhD at the MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour, and Development in sunny Sydney, Australia.  
My work focuses on how the brain makes sense of the visual world — specifically, how we recognize and process objects. I study this using neuroimaging, computational models like deep neural networks, and behavioral experiments.

I’m fascinated by the overlap between human perception and artificial intelligence — how insights from neuroscience can help improve machine learning models, and how AI can help us understand the brain in new ways.

Beyond research, I’m a big football fan (Bayern Munich), spend some time in the gym, and I am trying my best to make it to the World Surf League (I can barely stand up).

This site is where I share my [publications](/publications/), [teaching](/talks/) and the occasional update or resource.  
If you're curious about my work, feel free to reach out — I’m always up for a good conversation about brains, models, or data!
